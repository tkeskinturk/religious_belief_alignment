# Replication: Religious Belief Alignment

This repository provides the replication files for the paper *Religious Belief Alignment: The Structure of Cultural Beliefs from Adolescence to Emerging Adulthood*, published at [*Poetics* journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X21000814).

The pre-print version of the paper is stored at [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ft5zm/).

The NSYR datafiles used in the analyses can be downloaded from [the Arda](https://www.thearda.com/).

## Notes on Replication

One thing to note for replication is that peer network data used to generate Figure 5 requires an IRB approval and an agreement with the NSYR team. These variables are not publicly available in any platform.

The data structure in `./data/` (currently empty) is presented in `./misc/data.txt`.

## Updates in the Replication Package

_2023, November_: In order to strengthen the future replicability of the study, I updated this folder by reorganizing the folder structure and adding {{renv}} configurations for package compatibility.
